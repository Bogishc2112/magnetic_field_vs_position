# magnetic_field_vs_position
Code written for UCF physics with calculus 2 class lab. The goal of the lab is to examine possible dependacies between the position and orientation of the phone and the strength of magnetic field of the Earth based on the measurements of built-in smartphone magnetometer. The analisys of the data consists of checking datasets for different angles of the phone orientation for similarity by conducting a t-test between them, and estimating goodness of fit for 3 empirically chosen models(2 parabolic and 1 sine function, strength of magnetic field vs angle of phone orientation) by calculating corresponding chi-squared value for each model.
